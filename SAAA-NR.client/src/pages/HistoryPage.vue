      <h3> Caber Toss</h3>
      <p>
        The caber toss is one of the most distinctive of Highland Games events and often considered the quintessential
        Scottish athletic event. In this event, competitors lift and balance a large wooden pole—known as a "caber"—which
        can be up to 19 feet long and weigh over 100 pounds. The objective is not just to throw the caber, but to flip it
        end over end in a straight line from the point of origin. Athletes are judged on how closely their tosses
        approximate the ideal 12 o'clock position on a clock face.
      </p>

      <h3>Breamar Stone</h3>
      <p>
        Similar to the shot put found in modern athletics, the stone put involves throwing a heavy stone, typically
        weighing
        between 16 to 22 pounds for men and 8 to 12 pounds for women. Athletes may use any style to project the stone,
        such
        as "putting" from a standing position or using a glide or spin technique akin to modern shot put methods. The
        throw
        is measured for distance, and the athlete with the farthest legal throw is declared the winner.

      </p>

      <h3> Weight for Distance</h3>
      <p>
        The weight for distance event, also known as the "Scottish hammer throw," is a test of strength and technique.
        Competitors throw a metal weight attached to a chain and handle. The men's light weight is 28 pounds and the heavy
        weight is 56 pounds, while women throw weights of 14 and 28 pounds, respectively. The goal is to hurl the weight
        as
        far as possible using a spinning technique, and the athlete's feet must remain stationary until the weight is
        released.
      </p>

      <h3> Weight for Height</h3>
      <p>
        Also known as "weight over the bar," this event challenges athletes to toss a weight over a horizontal bar set at
        increasing heights. The weight, typically 56 pounds for men and 28 pounds for women, is thrown with one hand using
        a
        technique that generates upward momentum. Competitors have three attempts at each height, and the winner is the
        athlete who clears the highest height with the fewest misses.
      </p>

      <h3>Sheaf Toss</h3>
      <p>
        The sheaf toss is a traditional Scottish agricultural sport that has become a staple at modern Highland Games.
        Using
        a pitchfork, athletes loft a burlap bag filled with straw—weighing 20 pounds for men and 10 pounds for women—over
        a
        horizontal bar that increases in height with each round. The sheaf toss combines elements of technique, timing,
        and
        strength. While its origins are not definitively linked to ancient Highland activities, it remains a popular event
        with audiences for its excitement and spectacle.
      </p>

      <h3>Highland heritage</h3>
      <p>
        Celebrating Scottish Highland heritage, Highland Games are vibrant cultural festivals that occur in the warmer
        months across Scotland and in countries with significant Scottish communities. These events are a tribute to
        Scottish and Celtic traditions, marked by iconic symbols like bagpipes, kilts, and a range of athletic contests
        known as heavy events, including the famous caber toss.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cowal Highland Gathering, the premier event of its kind, is hosted annually in Dunoon, Scotland, drawing
        thousands of competitors and spectators from around the world. It's outshone only by larger festivals in the
        United
        States in terms of attendance, with the Scottish Highland Gathering and Games in California being the most
        significant in the Northern Hemisphere, ongoing since 1866.
      </p>
      <p>
        The origins of the games can be traced back to the reign of King Malcolm III, who, legend has it, sought the
        swiftest runner to be his royal messenger. Over time, these events evolved from clan warrior tests of strength and
        skill to what we see today: a mixture of competitive sports and cultural exhibitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        These modern gatherings, which blossomed in the 19th century after the lifting of the Highland dress ban, have
        spread globally. They serve as a beacon of Scottish culture, promoting traditional Highland attire, music, and
        clan
        heritage. Notably, the games were reportedly an inspiration to Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the
        modern
        Olympic Games, after he witnessed a display in Paris in 1889.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contemporary Highland Games feature a variety of athletic competitions such as the stone put, hammer throw, and
        weight throw. These events test the strength and skill of the athletes, and newer categories have been added to
        include women and masters competitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Music is also a central part of the games, with pipe bands often providing the soundtrack to the festivities.
        Piping
        and drumming competitions, along with fiddling and other forms of Celtic music, contribute to the celebratory
        atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Highland dancing is another key component, with competitions attracting dancers from around the globe. Dances like
        the Highland Fling and Sword Dance showcase the intricate and traditional steps passed down through generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the main events, Highland Games also offer clan tents, Scottish merchandise, historical reenactments,
        herding
        dog demonstrations, and traditional foods, creating a full cultural experience that transcends geographical
        boundaries and connects the Scottish diaspora with their rich heritage. </p>
